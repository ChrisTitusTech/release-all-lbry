## Release All Claims on LBRY

Many people know that LBRY is a youtube alternative, but getting paid can be a bit difficult and unlocking tips in LBC is cumbersome. Since I have better things to do than go through each video and click unlock. I created a linux CLI script to just do it by directly interfacing with LBRY protocol. 

This is very hacky and spammy. So you have been warned! However after running this, I get a large majority of those locked tips that I then can transfer out.
